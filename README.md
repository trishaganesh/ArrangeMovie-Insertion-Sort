# ArrangeMovie-Insertion-Sort
Having a list of movies, we can then sort them based on title, year created, or studio. By using the insertion sort algorithm, we reorder the collection either in ascending or descending order.

The purpose of this program is to understand how insertion methods work and how we can sort values stored in an Array; then, 
inserting them into an empty (second) array. 

Previous concepts such as traversals were needed to be remembered.

Area for improvement: 
At first, I struggled to understand how we could use insertion methods for int values vs String values 
(such as "movie title", "studio", or "year"). 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed working with insertion sort as my practice from previous programs allowed me to grasp these concepts quicker.
